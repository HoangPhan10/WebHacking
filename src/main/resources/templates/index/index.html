            <p class="item-msg">This application contains multiple critical vulnerabilities including XSS, SQL
                Injection, LDAP Injection, Code Injection, OS Command Injection, and more.
                It is also exposed to CSRF, SSRF, Clickjacking, Open Redirect, brute-force login, session hijacking, and
                file inclusion risks.
                These weaknesses allow attackers to exploit input validation flaws, bypass authentication, and
                compromise sensitive data.</p>

                This section demonstrates frequent runtime issues such as deadlocks, livelocks, thread starvation, and
                usage of non-thread-safe classes. It also covers infinite loops, redirect/forward loops, JVM crashes,
                and various resource leaks including memory, sockets, database connections, and file descriptors.
                These problems can lead to performance degradation, application instability, or complete system failure.

                This section introduces frequent exceptions encountered during Java application execution, such as
                NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ClassCastException, and IllegalArgumentException.
                It also covers concurrency-related issues like ConcurrentModificationException and
                IllegalMonitorStateException,
                as well as input/output errors including NumberFormatException, InputMismatchException, and
                MissingResourceException.
                Understanding these exceptions helps developers write robust code, improve error handling, and prevent
                unexpected application crashes.

                This section highlights critical errors that can occur during Java application execution, including
                OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, and AssertionError. It also covers linkage and initialization
                issues
                such as ExceptionInInitializerError, NoClassDefFoundError, and UnsatisfiedLinkError, as well as
                configuration
                problems like FactoryConfigurationError and TransformerFactoryConfigurationError. These errors often
                indicate
                serious problems in the JVM or application environment, requiring careful diagnosis and preventive
                measures
                to maintain system stability.

            <p class="item-msg">OS command injection (also known as shell injection) is a web security vulnerability
                that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system (OS) commands on the server that is
                running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and all its data. Very often, an
                attacker can leverage an OS command injection vulnerability to compromise other parts of the hosting
                infrastructure, exploiting trust relationships to pivot the attack to other systems within the
                organization.</p>

                breaches. Although relatively simple to learn, it can potentially be used for some high-severity
                exploits. This
                makes it an ideal first topic for beginners, and essential knowledge even for more experienced users</p>

                allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an
                attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites
                from interfering with each other.</p>
